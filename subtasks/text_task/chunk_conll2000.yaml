description: |
  Text chunking was the shared task for CoNLL-2000. This data consists of the same partitions of the Wall Street Journal corpus (WSJ) as the widely used data for noun phrase chunking: sections 15-18 as training data (211727 tokens) and section 20 as test data (47377 tokens). The annotation of the data has been derived from the WSJ corpus by a program written by Sabine Buchholz from Tilburg University, The Netherlands.
