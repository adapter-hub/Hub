  The Parallel Meaning Bank (PMB), developed at the University of Groningen and building upon the Groningen Meaning Bank, comprises sentences and texts in raw and tokenised format, syntactic analysis, word senses, thematic roles, reference resolution, and formal meaning representations. The main objective of the PMB is to provide fine-grained meaning representations for words, sentences and texts. Sentences are, in isolation, often ambiguous.
