  ComplexQuestions is a QA dataset originally created for querying knowledge bases.
  The questions are obtained from Google web queries and donâ€™t provide supporting context paragraphs inthe original dataset release.
  We use the CQ version released in MultiQA (Talmor and Berant, 2019) which additionally enriches all questions with retrieved web snippets, converting the task into an extractive QA task.

# (optional) A bibtex citation of the work related to this subtask.
