  MDB dataset having 50K movie reviews for natural language processing or Text analytics.
  This is a dataset for binary sentiment classification containing substantially more data than previous benchmark
  datasets. We provide a set of 25,000 highly polar movie reviews for training and 25,000 for testing. So, predict the
  number of positive and negative reviews using either classification or deep learning algorithms.
