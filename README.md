- `adapter_types` contains info cards for all types of adapters supported by our framework

- `adapters` is the place where all adapter info cards should go

- `architectures` contains info cards for all available adapter architectures. Add your own architecture here!

- `dist` contains generated files for adapters and architectures. _Auto-generated, do not modify anything here!_

- `scripts` contains script for validating the submitted adapters and info cards

- `subtasks` contains info cards for all available subtasks

- `tasks` contains info cards for all available tasks

## How To Contribute

Refer to [the step-by-step guides in our documentation](https://docs-legacy.adapterhub.ml/hub_contributing.html) on how to contribute your adapters to the Hub.

### AdapterHub CLI

The AdapterHub CLI provides command-line tools to help you contributing to the Hub, such as packaging adapters or validating filled-out yaml files.

To install the CLI from the cloned repository, you can run the following in this folder:
```
pip install -U ./scripts/.
```
Alternatively, you can install the CLI using:
```
pip install -U git+https://github.com/adapter-hub/hub.git#subdirectory=scripts
```

Now you can use the pack `pack` command to interactively prepare your adapters for upload and submission to the Hub:
```
adapter-hub-cli pack <folder_with_models_or_adapters>
```

To validate yaml files, run:
```
adapter-hub-cli check path/to/adapter.yaml
```
